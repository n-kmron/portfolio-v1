# Portfolio

## Description

Every dev has to have his own portfolio/website. Here's mine

## Code

-   Only use `HTML` `CSS` `JAVASCRIPT` to work (it's only a showcase so no framework).
-   Use CSS variables to make the switch between Dark and Light mode

## Note

This project will be available on Cameroon Portfolio as soon as finished.
